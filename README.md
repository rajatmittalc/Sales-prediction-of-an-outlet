# AV_MLPROJECTS

here i will add all the projects done by me on analytics vidhya.
This is my very first project using  pycaret library of python. this library is really amazing and gave me quite amazing results  without much coding.
earlier i tried doing this problem with conventional approach which took quite a good amount of time and lesse accuracy but this madethe work very easier and tune the model too is very  easy now. i recommend everyone to give it one shot.
